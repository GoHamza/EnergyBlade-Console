# Frequently asked questions:

My anti-virus is telling me KrnlAPI.dll / injector.dll / EnergyBlade.exe is a virus!!!!
- Don't worry, EnergyBlade and its files are not a virus! Most, if not all Roblox utilities like Krnl, Synapse X, and EnergyBlade are detected
  because they use DLL injection. But viruses also use DLL injection, so anti-viruses will notify and quarantine all injectors just to be safe. 
  Fix this by excluding EnergyBlade's folder in your anti-virus.

Does this work on MacOS / iOS / iPadOS / FreeBSD / Linux / Android / Windows 95?
- EnergyBlade is only tested on Windows 10. Other operating systems may not be guaranteed to run EnergyBlade properly.

Haha!! I skidded your code!!!!
- Good for you, it's open-source.
